# Project


## Deployment

dependencies for encrypting/decrypting service account secrets used in travis containers:
*travis gem*
gem install travis -v 1.8.10
thus we need ruby but we can just use a ruby container on local machine to encrypt the json file.


dependencies for ingress setup: 
*helm*
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/master/scripts/get-helm-3 > get_helm.sh
chmod 700 get_helm.sh
./get_helm.sh

helm repo add stable https://kubernetes-charts.storage.googleapis.com/
helm install my-nginx stable/nginx-ingress --set rbac.create=true 




My front-end experience includes plain JS, React, React Native and Vue.js. Backend experience includes Node.js among Ruby and Elixir in projects ranging from IoT platforms to handling of billing data. Currently I am keeping up my knowledge in JS and following a course on Udemy in TypeScript. In persistent domains I have worked with similar technologies such as e.g MongoDB, Firebase and Postgres. For API's I have mostly used classical REST API's designs.
